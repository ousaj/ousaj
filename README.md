## Hey there! 👋

I'm Oussama, a Software Engineer based in Barcelona, Spain. My focus is writing software that's simple, reliable and fast (in that order).

I am currently working on getting better at Rust and systems programming in order to apply for systems engineering jobs. I'll be posting my progress here.

My main tech stack is Angular, Java and TypeScript, although I have experience in projects using Rust, C, and React.

My favorite tools are Neovim (btw), a terminal (anything with Bash), and plain-text files. I keep it simple because that helps me understand the system better and lets me
focus on the important problems at hand.

I'll be pinning more projects soon, but my favorite one thus far is the [Eulerian fluid simulation](https://github.com/ousaj/fluid-sim), written in Rust, using OpenGL.
