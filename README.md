## Hey there! 👋

I'm Oussama, a Software Engineer based in Barcelona, Spain. 

My focus is to write software that's [simple, reliable and fast (in that order)](https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/09/Simple-correct-fast.html).

I'm currently working on getting better at Rust and systems programming in order to apply for systems engineering jobs. 

This is a profile where I'll be uploading projects, experiments, and things I'm currently working on. 
I'll be pinning more projects soon, but my favorite one thus far is this [Eulerian fluid simulation](https://github.com/ousaj/fluid-sim), written in Rust, using OpenGL.

My main tech stack is Angular, Java and TypeScript, although I have experience in projects using Rust, C, and React.

My favorite tools are neovim (btw), a terminal (anything with Bash), and plain-text files whenever possible. I keep it simple because that helps me understand the system better and lets me
focus on the important problems at hand.

## A bit about me

- 🧑‍🏭 In another life I would've become a carpenter.
- ☕ I have a crippling coffee dependency.
- 📚 I love the cyberpunk genre (please read *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*).
