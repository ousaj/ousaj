## Hi there 👋

I'm Oussama, a Software Engineer based in Barcelona, Spain.

I'm interested in systems programming, web and game development.

My main tech stack is Angular, Java and TypeScript, although I have experience with Rust, C, and React.

My favourite tools are Neovim (btw), a terminal (anything with Bash), and plain-text files. I keep it simple because that helps me understand the system better and lets me
focus on the important problems at hand.
